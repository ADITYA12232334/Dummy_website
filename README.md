-   **Vulnerability Dashboard**: View detailed results including severity breakdowns (High, Medium, Low, Info).
-   **Report Management**: Access and download detailed scan reports.
-   **Job Queuing**: Efficient job management using Redis for high performance and reliability.

## 🏗️ Architecture

-   **Frontend**: React (Vite), Tailwind-style CSS, Lucide icons.
